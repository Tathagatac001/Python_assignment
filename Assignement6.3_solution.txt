For a perticular student:

The probability of failing in 0 subjects, P(X=0) = 0.8

The probability of failing in 1 subjects, P(X=1) = 0.1

The probability of failing in 2 subjects, P(X=2) = 0.07

The probability of failing in 3 subjects, P(X=3) = 0.03


The probability distribution can be shown as:

 X 	 	0 	 1 	 2 	 3
 P(X) 		0.8 	 0.1 	 0.07 	 0.03
