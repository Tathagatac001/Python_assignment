1)Probality of getting 2 red balls

	for the first draw there are 4 red balls available out of a total of 10(4+6) balls.
	Therefore the chance to pick a red ball is 4 red / 10 total = 4/10
	 
	for the second draw there are 3 red balls (one has already been removed) available out of a total of 9 balls.
	Therefore the chance to pick a red ball is 3 red / 9 total = 3/9=1/3
	 
	Putting it all together, to find the chance of picking both red balls we multiply the probabilities because there is a formula that 		says that the probability of two events happening is the product of the individual probabilities as long as the events are independent.
	 
	So the answer is (4/10)(1/3) = 4/30 = .13

2)Probality of getting 2 black balls

	for the first draw there are 6 black balls available out of a total of 10(4+6) balls.
	Therefore the chance to pick a black ball is 6 black / 10 total = 6/10
	 
	for the second draw there are 5 black balls (one has already been removed) available out of a total of 9 balls.
	Therefore the chance to pick a black ball is 5 black / 9 total = 5/9
	 
	Putting it all together, to find the chance of picking both red balls we multiply the probabilities because there is a formula that 		says that the probability of two events happening is the product of the individual probabilities as long as the events are independent.
	 
	So the answer is (6/10)(5/9) = 30/90 = .33

3)Probality of getting first red ball then black ball.

	for the first draw there are 4 red balls available out of a total of 10(4+6) balls.
	Therefore the chance to pick a red ball is 4 red / 10 total = 4/10

	for the second draw there are 6 black balls (one has already been removed) available out of a total of 9 balls.
	Therefore the chance to pick a black ball is 6 black / 9 total = 6/9

	Probality of getting first red ball then black ball s (6/9)(4/10)=24/90=.27

4)Probabily of getting first black ball then red ball.

	for the first draw there are 6 black balls available out of a total of 10(4+6) balls.
	Therefore the chance to pick a red ball is 6 black / 10 total = 6/10

	for the second draw there are 4 red balls (one has already been removed) available out of a total of 9 balls.
	Therefore the chance to pick a black ball is 4 red / 9 total = 4/9

	Probality of getting first black ball then red ball (6/10)(4/9)=24/90=.27
