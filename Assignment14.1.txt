1. What are the three stages to build the hypotheses or model in machine learning?
Ans : Below are the three process to build a model in machine learing 
	1. Data preparation stage
	2. Algorithm choosing and trainging 
	2. Model building and monitoring

2.	What is the standard approach to supervised learning?
Ans: Below are steps followed in supervised learning.
		1. Determine the types of training data for fitting the model.
		2. Gathering training and testing data set for fitting the model and testing the model.
		3. Determine the input feature representation of the learned function.
		4. Determine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm.
		5. Evaluate the accuracy of learned function.

3. What is Training set and Test set?
Ans : Training Set: Basically training sets are the input dataset or features used to train a model. 
		The model learn or build properly as per selection of correct features to fit the model.
	Test set:  Test set are the data set to evaluate the model's performance. 
	And adjust or select the model by seeing the performance of the model. 			
		
4.  What is the general principle of an ensemble method and what is bagging and
boosting in ensemble method?

Ans : The general principle of an ensemble method is to improve the model performance/predictive power of the model.
 Bagging : Bagging is a process to improve the stability and accuracy of 
 machine learning algorithms used in supervised learning. It decrease the varience by lessening the bias in 
 predictive models.
 
 Boosting:In supervised learning boosting is an ensemble meta-algorithm that converts weak learners 
 to strong learners and improve model performance.
 
 5. How can you avoid overfitting ?
	Using bagging algorithm/regularization function overfitting problem can be avoid.
