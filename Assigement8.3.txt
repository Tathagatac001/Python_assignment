i)
z score formula for a sample is:
z = (x – μ) / σ

x=My test scrore(1100 here)
μ=sample mean(1026 here)

σ=standerd deviation(209 here)

So z=(1100-1026)/209=.354

ii)Now the probality of score getting less than 1100 is
P(x<1100)=P(x<.354)=.6368

So 63.68% people scored less than 1100.

iii)Hence 36.62% people scored greater than 1100.
