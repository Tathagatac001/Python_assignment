The formula for calculating the achievement of 'k' successes in 'n' trials is:
P ('k' successes in 'n' trials) = C(n,k)s**k(1−s)**(n−k) [ ** denoting power ]
C (n, k) is called the coefficient for binomial distribution or binomial coefficient.

n=number of trials attempted.
k=count of success within n trials
n-k=numbers of failures
s=probability of success in a trial
1-s=probability of failure

Here, n = 50, k = 5, n - k = 45.
The probability of success = probability of getting a "D"= s = 1/5
Hence, the probability of failure = probability of not getting a "D" = 1 - s = 4/5


When we substitute these values in the formula for Binomial distribution we get,

So, P ( 5 'D' out of 50 rolls) = C (50, 5) * (1/5)**5 * (4/5)**45 


P (5 out of 20) = 2118760 * .00032 * .00004

= 0.027 (approx)

Thus the required probability is 0.027 approximately.
